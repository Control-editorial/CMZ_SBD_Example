'Cycling_Motion' is a program designed for an initial test of the built-in PLC functionality of the SBD servo drives from CMZ:

This project is derived from the example code provided in the CMZ documentation, modified only to include homing to a switch connected to the GPIO.

Any real project involving motion (including bench tests) can be inherently unsafe, so be sure you follow all safety precautions as advised by the manufacturer. 

The Control.com engineering team is not liable for any misuse or unsafe execution of code, improper measurement/entry of axis limits, nor any differences between hardware arrangements which might cause damage to equipment or harm to people. 

In other words, use at your own risk - but at the same time, don't be afraid to try something new. Motion control is a fascinating and exciting topic!
